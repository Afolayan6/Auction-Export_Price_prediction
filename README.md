Overview

This project aims to predict car prices based on their features, leveraging data science techniques to create an accurate regression model. The project involves web scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based queries, and machine learning to generate actionable insights and predictions for the car sales domain.

Key Features

Web Scraping: Extracted car data from the Auction Export website.

Data Wrangling: Cleaned and structured the scraped data for analysis and modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.

SQL Integration: Utilized SQL queries to manage, filter, and analyze data efficiently.

Price Prediction Model: Developed a regression model to predict car prices based on features like mileage, year, make, model, and engine size.
